# Why distributed system
- parallelism
- fault tolerance
- physical 
- security / isolated
# challenge
- concurrency
- partial failure
- performance

# infrastructure
> build Abstractions
- storage

# Implementation
- RPC(Remote procedure call)
- Threads

# 3 Topic

## performance
- scalability(2 times computers -> 2 times throughout)

## Fault Tolerance 
- Availability
- Recoverability 
    - tools to solve: non volatile storage, replica

## Consistency 
- PUT,GET 
- Strong Consistency
- Weak Consistency

# MapReduce
